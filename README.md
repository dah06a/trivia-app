# G2i Trivia React Web Code Challenge

This project was built by David Henry using React.
The purpose of this application is to fulfil the requirements of the G2i React Web Test.
Specifications and requirements for this project can be found at https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/a9VLMKqmcL2hD19Be6UWym2b.

## How To Play

This project is a small trivia game app that displays 10 true/false trivia questions to the user.
To start playing, simply click the 'Begin!' button at the bottom of the screen.
The application will then fetch trivia data from an API at https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&difficulty=hard&type=boolean.
For each question displayed, select either 'True' or 'False'.
After 10 questions, you will be shown your score and results for each question with the option to play again.
